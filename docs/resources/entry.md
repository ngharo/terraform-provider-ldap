# ldap_entry (Resource)

Manages an LDAP entry. Each entry is identified by its Distinguished Name (DN) and contains object classes and attributes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a basic person entry
resource "ldap_entry" "user" {
  dn           = "cn=john.doe,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  object_class = ["person", "organizationalPerson", "inetOrgPerson"]

  attributes = {
    cn          = ["john.doe"]
    sn          = ["Doe"]
    givenName   = ["John"]
    mail        = ["john.doe@example.com"]
    description = ["Software Engineer"]
  }
}

# Create a group entry with single member
resource "ldap_entry" "group" {
  dn           = "cn=developers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
  object_class = ["top", "groupOfNames"]

  attributes = {
    cn          = ["developers"]
    description = ["Development team"]
    member      = [ldap_entry.user.dn]
  }
}

# Create an organizational unit
resource "ldap_entry" "department" {
  dn           = "ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"
  object_class = ["top", "organizationalUnit"]

  attributes = {
    ou          = ["engineering"]
    description = ["Engineering Department"]
  }
}

# Example: User with multiple email addresses (multi-valued attribute)
resource "ldap_entry" "user_multi_email" {
  dn           = "cn=jane.smith,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  object_class = ["person", "organizationalPerson", "inetOrgPerson"]

  attributes = {
    cn        = ["jane.smith"]
    sn        = ["Smith"]
    givenName = ["Jane"]
    mail = [
      "jane.smith@example.com",
      "jane.smith@company.example.com",
      "j.smith@example.com"
    ]
    telephoneNumber = [
      "+1-555-123-4567",
      "+1-555-987-6543"
    ]
    description = ["Senior Software Engineer", "Team Lead"]
  }
}

# Example: Group with multiple members (multi-valued attribute)
resource "ldap_entry" "group_multi_member" {
  dn           = "cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
  object_class = ["top", "groupOfNames"]

  attributes = {
    cn          = ["admins"]
    description = ["System Administrators"]
    member = [
      ldap_entry.user.dn,
      ldap_entry.user_multi_email.dn,
      "cn=admin,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dn` (String) The distinguished name (DN) of the LDAP entry. This uniquely identifies the entry in the LDAP directory tree. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `object_class` (List of String) List of object classes for the LDAP entry. Object classes define the schema and required attributes for the entry. Common values include `person`, `organizationalPerson`, `inetOrgPerson`, `groupOfNames`, and `organizationalUnit`.

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of List of String) Map of LDAP attributes for the entry. The keys are attribute names and values are lists of attribute values. For single-valued attributes, provide a list with one element. For multi-valued attributes like `member` in groups, provide a list with multiple elements. Note that `objectClass` is automatically managed and should not be included here.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this resource, which is the same as the DN.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import an existing LDAP entry using its DN
terraform import ldap_entry.user "cn=john.doe,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"

# Import a group entry
terraform import ldap_entry.group "cn=developers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"

# Import an organizational unit
terraform import ldap_entry.department "ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"
```
